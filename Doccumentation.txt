HOW IT WORKS 


Minimax Algorithm
The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm for turn-based games. It works by:

Building a game tree of possible moves
Evaluating leaf nodes (terminal positions)
Propagating scores up the tree
Maximizing score for the engine's turn
Minimizing score for the opponent's turn

Alpha-Beta Pruning
Alpha-Beta pruning optimizes Minimax by:

Maintaining alpha (best score for maximizing player)
Maintaining beta (best score for minimizing player)
Pruning branches that cannot affect the final decision
Reducing the search space significantly


Note where AI was used the entire GUI interface idk how to do that it doesnt reallly work either way  and Evaluation.py partially
